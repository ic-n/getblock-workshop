# Yellowstone gRPC API

## Overview

**Yellowstone gRPC** is a high-performance Solana Geyser plugin that provides real-time streaming access to on-chain data. Built by Triton One, it delivers blocks, transactions, and account updates with millisecond-level latency directly from Solana validators.

GetBlock offers **managed Yellowstone gRPC endpoints** as an add-on to Dedicated Solana Node subscriptions, eliminating the need for infrastructure setup and maintenance.

---

## Key Features

- **Near-zero latency**: Streams data directly from validators, often hundreds of milliseconds faster than standard RPC/WebSocket APIs
- **High throughput**: Handles millions of events per minute under load
- **Comprehensive streaming**: Monitor accounts, transactions, blocks, slots, and program interactions in real-time
- **Rich filtering**: Subscribe only to relevant updates using account keys, owner programs, or commitment levels
- **Protobuf encoding**: Receive parsed, typed messages instead of raw base64 data
- **Bidirectional streaming**: Maintain long-lived connections with built-in keep-alives

## Supported Data Streams

Yellowstone gRPC supports streaming the full range of Solana events:

| Stream Type      | Description                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Accounts**     | Real-time account updates including lamports, owner, and data |
| **Transactions** | Full transaction data with metadata and instruction details   |
| **Blocks**       | Block metadata including slot, parent slot, and timestamp     |
| **Slots**        | Slot notifications as they're processed by the leader         |
| **Block Meta**   | Block metadata with transaction counts and execution status   |

## Use Cases

Yellowstone gRPC is ideal for time-sensitive applications that need to react instantly to on-chain state changes:

- High-frequency trading and MEV bots
- On-chain indexers and data archives
- Real-time analytics dashboards
- DEX monitors and price feeds
- DeFi strategy engines
- Alerting and notification systems
- NFT marketplace trackers
- Wallet activity monitors

## Prerequisites

To use Yellowstone gRPC on GetBlock:

- A GetBlock account (sign up at [getblock.io](https://getblock.io))
- A [Dedicated Solana Node](https://docs.getblock.io/getting-started/plans-and-limits/choosing-your-plan) subscription
- Yellowstone gRPC add-on enabled (included at no extra cost with Dedicated Nodes)

---

## Quick Example

Here's a minimal TypeScript example to start streaming account updates:

```typescript
import Client, {
  SubscribeRequest,
  CommitmentLevel,
} from "@triton-one/yellowstone-grpc";

const client = new Client("https://go.getblock.io/", "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN");
const stream = await client.subscribe();

stream.write({
  accounts: ["YourWalletPubkeyHere"],
  commitment: CommitmentLevel.PROCESSED,
} as SubscribeRequest);

stream.on("data", (msg) => {
  if (msg.accountChange) {
    console.log(`Account updated: ${msg.accountChange.pubkey}`);
  }
});
```
